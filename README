COMMAND DOCUMENTATION

    Eac2json parses Schwab's Employee Awards Center transaction history page
    from HTML into JSON. The output is a sequence of entries, each of which
    is a key-value bag. They are in the same order as they appear in the
    input document. Eac2json coalesces "more details" entries into its
    parent entry; their key-values appear together as one.

    In order to use eac2json, you must first save the HTML from the Schwab
    Employee Awards Center history page. Go to the "My Equity Awards" tab,
    then to the "History & Statements" sub-tab. Set the date range to "All",
    and save the page to a file. Chrome doesn't seem to do very well; Safari
    works fine.
